> A web log viewer for Jave EE.

***

## Quick Start
Stompee allows you to view the log file online. All you need to do is include the stompee jar in your war file. 
Stompee is not meant to replace your log file, but rather assist you to easily look at certain parts of the log file online. Stompee can not handle the load of a very busy log file, so make sure to select the correct logger and level.
 
The stompee-core library is published to [maven central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22stompee-core%22)

In your pom.xml:
 
     <!-- Stompee -->
     <dependency>
            <groupId>com.github.phillip-kruger</groupId>
            <artifactId>stompee-core</artifactId>
            <version>1.1</version>
            <scope>runtime</scope>
     </dependency>

You can then go to the stompee ui :
> http://localhost:8080/your-application-context/stompee/

## Security
Stompee does not have it's own security. You should secure the the `/stompee` context within your own security model.
